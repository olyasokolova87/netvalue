# Improvements

**Business and prod environment:**

1. Time should save in client zone or server zone? (business needs)
2. Add domain models when needed, and mapping from persistence to domain and back
3. PostgresSQL more applicable for production environment rather then h2
4. Depends on tables size in database, add indexes on most selective table columns

**Technical debt:**

1. Create some logout button in swagger-ui page to switch users
2. e2e tests
3. > expand monitoring using prometheus
