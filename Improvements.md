# Improvements

In developing process I had some questions, that in real process I would like to discuss with business%%

1. Time should save in client zone or server zone (business needs)
2. Move some logics from session service to smaller parts as port of some adapter
3. Create entity out of domain service
4. Create some logout button in swagger-ui page to switch users
5. Add validation of unique charge connectors number in charge point
6. Repository tests
7. Create user in sql scripts only for dev profile
